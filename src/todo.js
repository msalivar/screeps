check if rooms have enemy creeps and enemy structures
mix up scout search order
no ramparts :(
make ramparts when within 2 spaces of walls or something
//delete room memory if no spawn
better avg source range calculation for haulers needed
when spawning extensions on left of spawn, build from right side
creeps reserve neighbor rooms and make a spawn there
spawn code wont work correctly with more than 1 spawn
long distance miners
