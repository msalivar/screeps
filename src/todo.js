spawn code wont work correctly with more than 1 spawn
optimize long distance mining - haulers and such
creeps can move to home room if not in it
source links?
spawn guard creeps for nearby hostile rooms?
creeps reserve neighbor rooms and make a spawn there
mix up scout search order
make ramparts 
better avg source range calculation for haulers needed
when spawning extensions on left of spawn, build from right side
make config file?
