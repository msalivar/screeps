if there is a harvest container, use max range on dropped resources
better hauler number code
missed roads from extension code cuz of init roads sites
improve spawner code
optimize long distance mining - haulers and such
creeps can move to home room if not in it
source links?
spawn guard creeps for nearby hostile rooms?
creeps reserve neighbor rooms and make a spawn there
mix up scout search order
make ramparts 
better avg source range calculation for haulers needed
when spawning extensions on left of spawn, build from right side
