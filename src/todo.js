source links?
creeps reserve neighbor rooms and make a spawn there
mix up scout search order
optimize long distance mining
no ramparts :(
make ramparts when within 2 spaces of walls or something
//delete room memory if no spawn
better avg source range calculation for haulers needed
when spawning extensions on left of spawn, build from right side
spawn code wont work correctly with more than 1 spawn
long distance miners
make config file?
